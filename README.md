# Prototype Example
Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

## Usage examples
The Prototype pattern is available in C# out of the box with a Cloneable interface.

## Identification
The Prototype pattern is available in C# out of the box with a Cloneable interface.

## Applicability
Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.

The Prototype pattern provides the client code with a general interface for working with all objects that support cloning. This interface makes the client code independent from the concrete classes of objects that it clones.

The Prototype pattern lets you use a set of pre-built objects, configured in various ways, as prototypes.
